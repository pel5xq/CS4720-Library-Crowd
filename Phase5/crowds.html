<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<h3>To post library statistics:</h3>
<p>
	Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/insert/library/@lib/section/@sec/crowd/@crowd/noise/@noise
	<br>
	Insert the following:
	<ul>
		- library name (or other place name)<br>
		- library section (or other section name)<br>
		- crowd level (1-5)<br>
		- noise level (1-5)
	</ul>
		The information will be inserted into the database.<br>
</p>

<h3>To browse library statistics:</h3>
<p>Depending on what you are interested in, you can explore stats based on different combinations of the following:
	<ul>
		- library name<br>
		- section name<br>
		- time of day<br>
		- day of the week (current day or other)
	</ul>

	<h4>1) Find stats based on library, section, and timespan</h4>
		Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/library/@lib/section/@sec/timespan/@minutes
		<br>
		Insert the following:
		<ul>
			- library name<br>
			- section name<br>
			- time in minutes
		</ul>
		What is returned:
		<ul>- average noise and crowd levels for a library in a given section within the past given number of minutes </ul>

		If no current stats are available, you can query the pattern for the current day in the same timespan instead.<br>
		Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/library/@lib/section/@sec/timespan/@minutes/day
		<ul>- pattern of average noise and crowd for average day of the week as today for a library section within the past given number of minutes</ul>

		OR for a given day of the week in the same timespan.
		<br>
		Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/library/@lib/section/@sec/timespan/@minutes/day/@day
		<br>
		Insert the following:
		<ul>
			- library name<br>
			- section name<br>
			- time in minutes<br>
			- day of the week (numerical - Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc.)
		</ul>
		What is returned:
		<ul>- pattern of average noise and crowd for a library section within the past given number of minutes and on a given day of the week</ul>

	<h4>2) Find stats based on library and timespan</h4>
		Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/library/@lib/timespan/@minutes
		<br>
		Insert the following:
		<ul>
			- library name<br>
			- time in minutes
		</ul>
		What is returned:
		<ul>- average noise and crowd for an entire library within the past given number of minutes</ul> 

		<br>
		If no current stats are available, you can query the pattern for the current day in the same timespan instead.<br>
		Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/library/@lib/timespan/@minutes/day
		<br>
		What is returned:
		<ul>- pattern of average noise and crowd for average day of the week as today for a library within the past given number of minutes </ul>

		OR for a given day of the week in the same timespan.
		<br>
		Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/library/@lib/timespan/@minutes/day/@day
		<br>
		Insert the following:
		<ul>
			- library name<br>
			- time in minutes<br>
			- day of the week (numerical - Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc.)
		</ul>
		What is returned:
		<ul>- pattern of average noise and crowd for average given day of the week as today for a library within the past given number of minutes </ul>

	<h4>3) Find pattern stats based on library, section, and current day of the week:</h4>
		Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/library/@lib/section/@sec/day
		<br>
		Insert the following:
		<ul>
			- library name<br>
			- section name
		</ul>
		What is returned:<ul>
		- pattern of average noise and crowd levels for an average day of the week as today in a given section<br>
		- example: what does Rice commons look like on this (*current day of week*)
	</ul>

	<h4>4) Find pattern stats based on library, section, and any day of the week</h4>
		Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/library/@lib/section/@sec/day/@day
		<br>
		Insert the following:
		<ul>
			- library name<br>
			- section name<br>
			- any day of the week (numerical - Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc.)
		</ul>
		What is returned:<ul>
		- pattern of average noise and crowd levels for an average day of the week as given day for a given section<br>
		- example: what does Rice commons look like on a Monday
	</ul>

	<h4>5) Find pattern stats based on library and current day</h4>
		Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/library/@lib/day
		<br>
		Insert the following:
		<ul>
			- library name
		</ul>
		What is returned:<ul>
		- pattern of average noise and crowd levels for average day of the week as today for entire library
		</ul>


	<h4>6) Find the pattern stats based on library and any day of the week</h4>
		Link: http://plato.cs.virginia.edu/~pel5xq/library/@lib/day/@day
		<br>
		Insert the following:
		<ul>
			- library name<br>
			- any day of the week (numerical - Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc.)
		</ul>
		What is returned:
		- pattern of average noise and crowd levels for average given day of the week for entire library
